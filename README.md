# This is a Pygame project I did for my Physics in game engines class, consisting of several Python files that run their own game with physics calculations

In order to properly install and use this project, consider the following.

## DeV Environment
This needs pygame installed on your computer in order to run in it's base code like this. You can learn how to install pygame here: https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted

Furthermore, you will need to have python installed. Whatever the latest version is, should work just fine.

Lastly, the best IDE to run this project is VS Code, as you can easily add any extensions you need for your environment and can also run individual files with ease.

# Projects!

## Orbital Pacman
Play pacman, but in space! Eat objects as you and those objects orbit around the sun.

## Slinky!
Just a simple slinky script! This was used to test spring forces and bond forces.

## Astroblaster!
Play as a ground defense cannon trying to defend the earth from things hitting the ground! This project primarily focused on collision detection for complex 2 Dimensional Shapes, and applying directional velocity to those objects.

## Bocce!
Just a Bocce game! This project was used to apply directional velocity, as well as friction forces.

## Cut the Rope!
A recreation of the hit mobile game "Cut the Rope". Primarily testing collision detection, bond forces, gravity, wind forces applied on an object, and much more!

## Pinball!
A recreation of pinball! Forces used are primarily just applying velocity to objects while accounting for continuous collision, meaning you don't resolve the collision right on impact!

## Platformer!
A simple platformer game, testing simple collision detection as well as testing friction forces
